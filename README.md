# WatchTrackerAndroidApp

## Project overview
The Project has been created as a part of an android assignment from the 4th semester at VIA University College. The project aims to create an android application for viewing movie description and sorting them as well as keeping track of them.

As a lot of movies have been coming out, it has become a large problem for current watchers to keep track of them, hence we decided on this theme, to help people to have a better overview and be able to choose the movies that better suits their tastes. 

## Functional requirements
1.	As a user I would like to create an account to be able to view the movies’ information.
2.	As a user I want to view a movie description to see the concrete information about this specific movie.
3.	As a user I would like to have a “Watch Later” list for the movies that I would like to see in the future.
4.	As a user I would like to have a list of the movies that I have already watched to keep track of them.
5.	As a user, I would like to add movies to my favorite list to have my favorite movies in one place.
6.	As a user, I want to search specific movies so I can add them to my list. 
7.	As a user I would like to view the lists of movies sorted by genres to narrow down the searching process. 
8.	As a user, I would like to rate the movie to show how enjoyable the movie was.
9.	As a user I want to give reviews to the films I have already watched to express my opinion about them.
10.	As a user I would like to choose 3 genres I mostly like to see the recommendation list of the movies.
